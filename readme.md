A project about point-and-vector formations in three phases. The first phase was to calculate potential parallelograms from a collection of 3 points, while the second was calculate the Fermat point of a triangle formed from a collection of 3 points.

For the third phase, I worked with Kaushi Chandraratna and Philip Huynh to create a triangle-based fractal tree.
